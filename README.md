# CASCON 2017 - Neural Networks Workshop
This repository contains the artifacts during a presentation at [CASCON 2017](https://www-01.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/)

The workshop was delivered in two major parts

# Part 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning using Scikit-learn
This part of the workshop is an introduction to machine learning concepts and terminalogy using one of the popular libraries called (scikit-learn)[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/]

The examples are written in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Notebook.

You can run this either in your local environment or on a hosted solution

## Local environment
The fastest way to get a local environment suitable to run jupyter notebooks with most of the libraries is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

### Steps
- Git clone or download this repository on your local machine
- Open a command prompt and change to the directory where this repository is localed
- Execute `jupyter notebook`, which will run the server and open your default browser, listing the available folders and notebooks
- From the resulting interface navigate into the `lab` directory and open the notebook

## Hosted environment
You can load the [notebook](scikit-learn/lab/lab-part1.ipynb) in this repository into the [IBM Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com/) (i.e. DSX) solution.

# Part 2 - Introduction Neural Networks
This is an introduction
